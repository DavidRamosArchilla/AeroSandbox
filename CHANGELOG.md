AeroSandbox Changelog
=====================

This log keeps track of any major or breaking changes to AeroSandbox. It is not intended to be a comprehensive log of all changes (for that, see [the commit history](https://github.com/peterdsharpe/AeroSandbox/commits/master)), but attempts to catalog all major changes that practical industry users might care about. For this reason, patch versions might have no changelog entries at all.

Note that AeroSandbox development makes a good effort to adhere to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), so breaking changes will be accompanied by a major version bump. Note that AeroSandbox does not consider reordering keyword arguments to be a breaking change, so this will not result in a major version bump - so use keyword arguments whenever possible! (This is a good practice anyway, since it makes your code more readable.)
