    "Welcome to the first AeroSandbox tutorial!\n",
    "\n",
    "AeroSandbox is fundamentally a tool for solving optimization problems that are relevant to large, multidisciplinary engineered systems. Because of this, the most important part of AeroSandbox is the `Opti` stack, which allows you formulate and solve an optimization problem in natural mathematical syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Opti` class inherits directly from the `Opti` class of CasADi, the library AeroSandbox uses for algorithmic differentiation. AeroSandbox's `Opti` class extends this interface with syntax tailored specifically for engineering design. We'll explore more of these advanced features later!\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let's solve a classic optimization problem used for benchmarking: the 2D Rosenbrock problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, it is stated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "With decision variables x and y:\n",
    "Minimize: (a-x)**2 + b*(y-x**2)**2\n",
    "for a = 1, b = 100.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a tricky problem, because the minimum lies at the bottom of a shallow, curving valley. Let's go!"
