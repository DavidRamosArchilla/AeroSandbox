In the previous example, we solved a constrained Rosenbrock problem.

The Rosenbrock problem is a nonlinear problem, but it's just a mix of polynomials really. This means that we can
express it with overloaded Python operators: [+, -, *, /, **, ...] and so on.

But what if we want to use a function that's not part of the
