(The hand-calc process is a bit more complicated than before, but not bad. First, we would show that first-order optimality (i.e. $\\nabla \\vec{x} = 0$) can't be satisfied anywhere in the feasible space, which would indicate that our inequality constraint is tight. Then, we would derive the KKT conditions for constrained optimality and then solve for $x$, $y$, and the Lagrange multiplier associated with our constraint.)"
