# AeroSandbox Tutorial

by Peter Sharpe

-----

Welcome to the AeroSandbox tutorial!

Here's how this works: 
* Read through the folders and files in ascending order. Read the `README.md` in each subfolder, if it exists.
* Every tutorial subsection is a Jupyter Notebook. You can either:
  * [View them on GitHub non-interactively](https://github.com/peterdsharpe/AeroSandbox/tree/master/tutorial)
  * View them on your computer interactively (recommended). If you're new to Jupyter notebooks, [follow this tutorial here](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-use-jupyter-notebooks).
* Each tutorial file is designed to take ~5 minutes to read through and will introduce you to several new features.

Happy reading!
