# AeroSandbox Tutorial
-----
Welcome to the AeroSandbox tutorial!

tl;dr: the first tutorial section is [available here](01%20-%20Optimization%20and%20Math/1%20-%202D%20Rosenbrock.ipynb).

Here's how this works: 

* Read through the folders and files in ascending order. Upon opening any folder, be sure to read the `README.md` in the folder, if it exists.

* Every tutorial subsection is a Jupyter Notebook. You can either:

  * [View them on GitHub non-interactively](https://github.com/peterdsharpe/AeroSandbox/tree/master/tutorial) (easiest)

  * View them on your computer interactively (recommended). If you're new to Jupyter notebooks, [follow this tutorial here](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-use-jupyter-notebooks).

* Each tutorial file is designed to take ~5 minutes to read through and will introduce you to several new features.

* Many of the Markdown files (such as the `README.md` files) use inline LaTeX to represent mathematical equations. Your viewing experience will be **greatly** improved if you get a modern Markdown editor like [Typora](https://typora.io/) (once you get Typora, be sure to turn on "Inline LaTeX" in Preferences). [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and VSCode will also render Markdown well. Side note: If you're a scientist unfamiliar with Markdown with a modern editor, you're in for a real treat - download Typora and have your mind blown! 

Happy reading!
