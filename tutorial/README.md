# AeroSandbox Tutorial

by Peter Sharpe

-----

Welcome to the AeroSandbox tutorial!

Here's how this works: 
* Read through the folders in the order denoted, starting with `1 - Optimization and Math`. 
  
* In each folder, first read through the `README.md`, if one exists. Then read through the files in the order denoted.
* Comments will be added throughout the code when **new** features are introduced, so that these new features are made more obvious.
* Consider executing these scripts in an IPython terminal so that you can explore and manipulate the data structures left over at the end of each script.

Happy reading!
