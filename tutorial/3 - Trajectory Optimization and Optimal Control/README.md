# Trajectory Optimization and Optimal Control

Before learning how to do trajectory optimization and optimal control in AeroSandbox, you should learn the math behind these concepts.

Matthew Peter Kelly does an incredible job introducing these concepts. Copied from [his website](http://www.matthewpeterkelly.com/tutorials/trajectoryOptimization/index.html):

* [An Introduction to Trajectory Optimization (.pdf)](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/16M1062569)

Russ Tedrake also has an excellent presentation of trajectory optimization topics on his course website for MIT's Underactuated Robotics: [see here](http://underactuated.mit.edu/trajopt.html)
