    "# (More) Nonlinear functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous examples, we solved a constrained Rosenbrock problem and the sphere problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "While both of these problems are nonlinear, they're really just a mix of simple polynomials. This means that we can\n",
    "express it with overloaded Python operators: `+, -, *, /, **,` and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we want to use a function that's not part of simple arithmetic - something like $\\cos(x)$, for example?\n",
    "That's what we'll explore here!\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the coolest things about the `Opti` stack is that it's fast - really, **really** fast. You can solve\n",
    "nonlinear, nonconvex optimization problems with thousands of variables in mere seconds on a laptop, thanks to\n",
    "automatic differentiation (AD) provided by CasADi and modern optimization methods via IPOPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for AD to work, we need to be able to make a list (more precisely, a directed graph) of each mathematical\n",
    "operation (think `+, -, *, /, **, log(), fabs(),` etc.) that's applied throughout our optimization formulation (some\n",
    "call this list a \"trace\" in the literature).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we can't just use NumPy out of the box like we'd like to,\n",
    "because some of its functions break our trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we need to use a custom math library, which sounds scary at first. However, the AeroSandbox development team\n",
    "has tried to make this as seamless to you as possible - by writing our own NumPy with identical syntax! Here's how\n",
    "this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `aerosandbox.numpy` imports the entirety of NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For NumPy functions that break our AD trace (e.g. `np.sum()`), we've rewritten our own versions of them. This\n",
    "means:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t* If you pass normal NumPy arrays to these functions, they'll work 100% exactly the same as they would in\n",
    "\toriginal NumPy - same result and same speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t* If you pass optimization variables to these functions, they'll intelligently switch over to a version of the\n",
    "\tfunction that allows us to preserve the AD trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **So what does this mean for you, dear user?** It means that when working with AeroSandbox, all you need to do\n",
    "is replace `import numpy as np` with `import aerosandbox.numpy as np`, and you're good to go!\n",
    "\n",
    "* Caveat: Not all NumPy functions that should be overwritten have been overwritten - we've done our best,\n",
    "but there are *sooo* many obscure NumPy functions! If you get an error on a function you want to use,\n",
    "raise an issue ticket!\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that in our last example, we imported `aerosandbox.numpy` in order to use the `sum()` function.\n",
    "\n",
