    An interface to AVL, a 3D vortex lattice aerodynamics code developed by Mark Drela at MIT.

    Requires AVL to be on your computer; AVL is available here: https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/avl/

    It is recommended (but not required) that you add AVL to your system PATH environment variable such that it can
    be called with the command `avl`. If this is not the case, you need to specify the path to your AVL
    executable using the `avl_command` argument of the constructor.

    Usage example:

    # TODO

    """

    def __init__(self,
                 airplane: Airplane,
                 op_point: OperatingPoint,
                 avl_command: str = "avl",
                 verbose: bool = False,
                 working_directory: str = None,
                 ):
        """
        Interface to AVL.

        Args:

            airplane: The airplane object you wish to analyze.

            op_point: The operating point you wish to analyze at.

            avl_command: The command-line argument to call AVL.

                * If AVL is on your system PATH, then you can just leave this as "avl".

                * If AVL is not on your system PATH, thjen you should provide a filepath to the AVL executable.

                Note that AVL is not on your PATH by default. To tell if AVL is on your system PATH, open up a
                terminal and type "avl".

                    * If the AVL menu appears, it's on your PATH.

                    * If you get something like "'avl' is not recognized as an internal or external command..." or
                    "Command 'avl' not found, did you mean...", then it is not on your PATH and you'll need to
                    specify the location of your AVL executable as a string.

                To add AVL to your path, modify your system's environment variables. (Google how to do this for your OS.)
